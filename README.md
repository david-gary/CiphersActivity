# CiphersActivity
Cipher solving tools made for CryptoCamp 2021

Features included:
  - Character frequency calculator for solving substitution ciphers
  - Password strength calculator, which uses Moore's law as the backbone for calculating bruteforce solve time
  - Substitution cipher encryption tool and decryption tool

Ways this project could be improved
  - Styling is minimal. Functionality was the only intended goal
  - Intended for use exclusively on a LAN with properly authenticated users. Integrating this into a full website would be ideal.
